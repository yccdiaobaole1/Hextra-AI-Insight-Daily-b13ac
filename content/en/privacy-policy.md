-   Email address
-   Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data gets automatically collected when you use the Service.

Usage Data might include your device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. 📊

When you're accessing the Service through a mobile device, we might automatically scoop up certain info. This includes, but isn't limited to, the type of mobile device you're rocking, your mobile device's unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser you're using, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

When you hit up our Service or access it through a mobile device, we might also collect the info your browser sends our way. Just sayin'.

### Tracking Technologies & Cookies
We use Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep tabs on activity on our Service and store certain info. The tracking technologies we deploy include beacons, tags, and scripts. They're all about collecting and tracking info, plus improving and analyzing our Service. The tech we use might include:

-   **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: A Cookie is a tiny file plonked onto your device. You can tell your browser to straight-up refuse all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's being sent. But, if you don't play nice with Cookies, you might not be able to use certain parts of our Service. Unless you've tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, our Service will likely use them.
-   **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and our emails might contain small electronic files called Web Beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs). These little guys let the Company (for example) count users who've visited those pages or opened an email, and for other related website stats (like tracking the popularity of a certain section and making sure the system and server are running smoothly).

Cookies can be either "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies chill on your personal computer or mobile device even after you're offline, while Session Cookies vanish the moment you slam shut your web browser. 💨

We use both Session and Persistent Cookies for the purposes outlined below:

-   **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Session Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are super crucial for hooking you up with services available through the Website and letting you use some of its cool features. They help verify user identities and prevent shady use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services you've asked for simply won't work, and we only use 'em to deliver those services to you.

-   **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies are used to check if users have given their 'okay' to the use of Cookies on the Website.

-   **Functionality Cookies**
    -   **Type**: Persistent Cookies
    -   **Administered by**: Us
    -   **Purpose**: These Cookies let us remember the choices you make when you're using the Website, like recalling your login deets or language preferences. The whole point of these Cookies is to give you a more personalized experience and save you the hassle of re-entering your preferences every single time you use the Website. Smart, right? 🧠

For more deets on the Cookies we use and what choices you have about 'em, feel free to hit up our Cookies Policy or the Cookies section of our Privacy Policy.

### How We Use Your Personal Data
The Company might use Personal Data for the following purposes:

-   **For providing and maintaining our Service**, including keeping an eye on how our Service is being used.
-   **For managing your account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you provide lets you tap into different features available to you as a registered user.
-   **For the performance of a contract**: This involves the development, compliance, and execution of the purchase contract for products, items, or services you've bought, or any other contract made with us through the Service.
-   **To contact you**: We might get in touch via email, phone calls, SMS, or other equivalent electronic communication forms (like push notifications from a mobile app). We'll keep you informed with updates or informative comms related to features, products, or contracted services, including security updates, when it's necessary or reasonable. 📞
-   **To provide you with news**, special offers, and general info about other goods, services, and events we offer that are similar to what you've already purchased or inquired about, unless you've opted out of receiving such info.
-   **To manage your requests**: We'll process and handle those requests you send our way.
-   **For business transfers**: We might use your info to evaluate or go through with a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This applies whether it's a going concern or part of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data held by us about our Service users is among the assets being transferred.
-   **For other purposes**: We might also use your info for other stuff, like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out how effective our promo campaigns are, and to evaluate and improve our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Pretty neat, huh? ✨

We might share your personal info in these situations:

-   **With Service Providers**: We might share your Personal Info with Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service, and to get in touch with you.

-   **With other users**: When you swap Personal Info or get interactive with other users in public areas, that info might be seen by all users and could even be publicly posted outside. So, maybe don't spill *all* your secrets! 😉
-   **With your consent**: We might dish out your Personal Info for any other purpose if you give us the green light. ✅

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will only keep your Personal Data for as long as needed for the purposes laid out in this Privacy Policy. We'll hold onto and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to play by our legal obligations (like, if we gotta keep your data to comply with applicable laws), iron out disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for internal analysis. Usage Data is usually kept for a shorter period, unless that data is used to beef up the security of our Service or improve its functionality, or if we're legally obliged to keep this data for longer. Keeping things tight! 🔒

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (including Personal Data) gets processed at the Company's operating offices and any other spots where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means this info might be transferred to — and kept on — computers outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws might differ from your own turf.

By agreeing to this Privacy Policy and submitting such info, you're giving a nod to that transfer. Got it? 👍

The Company will take all reasonably necessary steps to make sure your data is handled securely and in line with this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless there are adequate controls in place (including security for your data and other personal info).

### Deleting Your Personal Data
You've got the right to delete or ask us for help deleting Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might let you zap certain info about yourself from right inside the Service.

You can always log into your account (if you've got one) and hit up the account settings section that lets you manage your personal info. From there, you can update, modify, or delete your info. You can also ping us to request access, correction, or deletion of any Personal Info you've given us.

But heads up, we might need to keep some info when we've got a legal obligation or a lawful basis to do so. Just gotta follow the rules! ⚖️

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company gets tangled up in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll give you a heads-up before your Personal Data is moved and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law Enforcement
In certain scenarios, the Company might be asked to spill your Personal Data if required by law or in response to valid requests from public authorities (like a court or government agency). 👮‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might cough up your Personal Data, believing in good faith that such action is necessary to:

-   Follow legal obligations
-   Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
-   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing connected with the Service
-   Protect the personal safety of Service users or the general public
-   Guard against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of your Personal Data is a big deal to us, but keep in mind that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is ever 100% secure. While we totally bust our butts to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we just can't guarantee its absolute security. It's the internet, after all! 🤷‍♀️

## Children's Privacy
Our Service isn't aimed at anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone younger than 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has provided us with Personal Data, please hit us up. If we discover we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll take steps to wipe that info from our servers. Kids, stay safe online! 🧒👧

If we need to lean on consent as the legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires parental consent, we might ask for your parent's approval before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll get whisked away to that third party's site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit. Stay savvy! 🌐

We've got zero control over the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services, and we don't take any responsibility for them either. Just putting it out there!

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We might update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We'll let you know about any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before the changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, and we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises here! 🗓️

You're advised to check this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy go live when they're posted on this page.
