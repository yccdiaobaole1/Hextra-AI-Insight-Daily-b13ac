# Terms of Service
*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
So, what do we offer? Our Site hooks users up with paid subscription content and member services. This includes cool stuff like blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions, just to name a few. Heads up: some content is only for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- To snag an account, users gotta provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Your account, your responsibility! Users are on the hook for their account's security and all activities happening there. And nope, **transferring or sharing your account is a big no-no**.
- If a user breaks these terms, the Site totally reserves the right to **suspend or even terminate** their account.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually, and you'll see the exact fees crystal clear on the checkout page.
- All payments get processed through awesome third-party payment platforms (think Stripe, PayPal, etc.). Don't worry, we don't store any of your payment info ourselves.
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy is pretty sweet**: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally stoked with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets this one-time refund chance. If it's been more than 14 days or it's not your first rodeo, then sorry, **no refunds** after payment, unless the law absolutely forces us to.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- Our original content? It's all **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reposting, or using it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff for personal learning and reading.
- If you're looking to use it commercially or need to quote a bunch, just reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct
Now for **User Conduct – play nice, folks!**
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights.
- Also, it's a **hard pass** on using tech tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-exclusive content.
- We totally reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. 🚫

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or even pull the plug on some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Sorry, that's just how it rolls sometimes!
- If stuff temporarily goes offline due to things beyond our control (think acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages), the Site **won't be liable for any compensation**.

## 7. Disclaimer
Time for the **Disclaimer**:
- The info our Site provides is purely for reference. It **does not constitute** any professional advice whatsoever (like financial, legal, medical, you get the drift).
- For any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services, the Site **is absolutely not responsible**. Just so we're clear!

## 8. Governing Law
And finally, **Governing Law**.
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- If any dispute pops up because of or related to these terms, both parties agree to try and sort it out amicably first. If that doesn't work out, then you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
