# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll just call "the Site" or "we" from now on). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to read through these Terms of Service. By hitting up our Site or using anything we offer, you're pretty much saying, "Yep, I agree to all this!"

## 1. Quick Look at Our Services

The Site offers users a bunch of cool stuff like paid subscription content and exclusive member services. We're talking blog posts, special resources, e-books, community interactions, and more! Just a heads-up, some content is only available to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Your Account

- Users need to whip up an account by providing a valid email address and setting a password.
- Users are totally on the hook for their account's security and everything that happens under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing your account!**
- The Site reserves the right to **pause or terminate** any account if a user goes against these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, and you'll see all the deets on the checkout page.
- All payments are handled securely through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal) – we don't store any of your payment info ourselves. Phew!
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day Refund Policy** is pretty sweet: First-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first time subscribing, all payments are **non-refundable** unless required by law. No take-backsies then!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! You can't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our stuff for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself!
- For commercial use or if you want to quote a lot, hit up the Site to get our authorization. Don't be shy!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

- Users are **strictly forbidden** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Play nice, people!
- Users, it's a big fat **NO** to bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking member content using any tech trickery.
- The Site has the right to yank down inappropriate content and **ban any rule-breaking users**. Seriously, don't test us.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

- We hold the cards to change, pause, or totally ditch some or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up. Just how it rolls!
- The Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. Bummer, but true.

## 7. Disclaimer

- The Site provides info for reference only, and it **doesn't count as** any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.). Don't take it as gospel!
- The Site **isn't responsible for jack** when it comes to any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Governing Law

- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of California, USA, without bringing in any conflict of law principles. West Coast vibes!
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms? First off, both parties should try to work it out amicably. If that doesn't fly, you agree to take it to the courts with jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California. Let's hope it doesn't come to that! 😉
