# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the **Site**" or "we")! Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using our Site, you're signaling your agreement and acceptance of these terms. 😎

## 1. About Our Services
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This cool stuff includes (but isn't limited to!) blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only for our awesome subscribers. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- Users are responsible for the security of their account and all activities on it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account.
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** user accounts if these terms are violated.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed via third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Don't worry, we don't store your payment info. 🔒
- Subscriptions will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before the end of your current billing cycle.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: Heads up! For first-time subscribers, if you're not totally thrilled with our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for subsequent subscriptions, payments are **non-refundable** unless legally mandated. No take-backs, sorry! 💔

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without permission. That's a no-go! 🙅‍♀️
- Users get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading only. Think of it as your personal library pass. 📚
- If you're looking to use our content for commercial purposes or need to quote extensively, please reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Do not** upload, post, or spread any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights. Let's keep it clean, folks! 🚫
- **Do not** use technical means to bulk download, crawl, or crack member-only content. Seriously, that's not cool. 😠
- The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**. Play nice or get kicked out! 👋

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate some or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up! 🤷‍♀️
- If content becomes temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions, the Site **is not liable for compensation**. It's out of our hands sometimes. 💨

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical). We're not pros in those areas, so always double-check with the real experts! 🤓
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using our content or services. Use at your own risk, folks! ⚠️

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising out of or related to these terms shall first be resolved through friendly negotiation between the parties. If negotiations fail, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
