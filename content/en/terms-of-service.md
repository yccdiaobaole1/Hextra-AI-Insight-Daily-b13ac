# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "**the Site**" or "**we**" from now on)! 🎉 Before you start exploring our awesome services, please take a moment to carefully read through these Terms of Service. Seriously, it's important! Your access or use of the Site means you're totally on board with these terms. Cool?

## 1. Service Overview
What do we do? Well, **the Site** is all about hooking you up with paid subscription content and sweet membership services. We're talking blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, lively community interactions, and more! Keep in mind, some of the really cool stuff is exclusively for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Account
- **To snag an account**, you'll need a valid email address and to set up a password. Easy peasy!
- **Your account** is your responsibility! You're totally on the hook for its security and everything that happens under your login. So, no transferring or sharing your account – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
- **The Site** holds the power to *pause or terminate* your account if you ever breach these terms. Just sayin'!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services**? We bill 'em monthly or yearly, and you'll see all the costs upfront on the checkout page. No hidden fees, ever! 🤑
- **All payments** are handled securely through awesome third-party platforms like Stripe and PayPal. Just so you know, **the Site** never, ever stores your payment info. Your security is our priority! 🔒
- **Your subscription** will keep rolling with *auto-renewal* unless you decide to hit 'cancel' before your current billing cycle wraps up. Don't forget!
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet: If it's your *first time* subscribing and you're not totally thrilled within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just ping us at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us what's up. Heads-up: Each user gets *one* shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, we generally say *no refunds* unless the law explicitly tells us otherwise. Fair is fair! ✨

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** here? It's totally copyrighted by us, **the Site (hubtoday)**. That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without our express permission. Got it? 🧐
- **You (the user)** only get a *non-exclusive, non-transferable* pass to access our content for your personal learning and reading pleasure. Keep it to yourself, alright? 😉
- **Thinking about commercial use or quoting a bunch of our stuff?** Awesome! Just reach out to us first to get proper authorization. We're usually pretty cool about it! 👍

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Seriously, don't** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Just don't. 🚫
- **Also, no sneakiness!** Bulk downloading, scraping, or trying to crack our member-only content with tech tricks is a big fat *no*.
- **The Site** gets to play bouncer here: We can remove any funky content and will totally *ban users* who break the rules. You've been warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** gotta keep things flexible, so we reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even yank parts or all of our services whenever we need to, without giving you a heads-up. It's just how the tech world rolls! 🤷‍♀️
- **The Site** can't be held responsible if our content goes dark temporarily due to stuff outta our control – like acts of God, server hiccups, or third-party service outages. So, no compensation claims there, folks. Bummer, we know! 😔

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The info we dish out here**? It's just for general reference, folks. It's *not* professional advice – definitely not financial, legal, medical, or anything like that. Always chat with a pro for specific advice! 🧠
- **The Site** won't be on the hook for any direct or indirect losses you might face from using our content or services. Just a heads-up! 😬

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are all about the laws of the State of California, USA, and will be interpreted according to them – without getting tangled in any conflict of law principles. Standard legal stuff!
- **Got a beef arising from or related to these terms?** Let's try to hash it out nicely first with some friendly negotiation. If we can't sort it, then you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. Just putting it out there! 🤝
