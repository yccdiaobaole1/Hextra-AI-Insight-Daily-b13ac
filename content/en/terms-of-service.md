Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're signaling that you agree to and accept these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site provides users with paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, handy e-books, and lively community interactions. Just a heads-up, some content is exclusively for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration and Account
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register an account.
- Users are solely responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** user accounts if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed monthly or annually, with all fees clearly stated on the checkout page.
- Payments are processed through trusted third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, the Site doesn't store your payment info.
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before the current billing cycle ends.
- **14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers who find themselves less than thrilled with the service can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless the law says we absolutely have to.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Copying, reproducing, or using it for commercial purposes without authorization is a big no-no.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right of access** for personal learning and reading.
- For any commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It is **strictly prohibited** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or steps on anyone else's rights.
- It is **also prohibited** to mass download, crawl, or try to crack member content using technical tricks.
- The Site has the power to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- We reserve the right to tweak, pause, or completely shut down parts or all of our services at any time, without giving you a heads-up.
- The Site **takes no responsibility for compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to things beyond our control, like force majeure, server hiccups, or third-party service outages.

## 7. Disclaimer
- Information provided by the Site is just for reference. It **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical wisdom).
- The Site **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might face from using the Site's content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and will be interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, United States, without getting tangled up in conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes that pop up from or relate to these terms should first be sorted out through friendly negotiation. If talks don't work, you agree to let the courts in Santa Clara County, California handle it.
